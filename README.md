# learnerApp
- is a school management system that provides a way to register or admit a student, and enroll them into their different courses and classes, connect them with their lecturers.
- The scholl also registers a lecturer with the courses they teach, the lecturer will then be connected with the students.
- It provides a way to record classes and upload to the school system for students. The school can decide whether to make the class available for download by the students or just access it live from the server.
- The app is designed to work only within or arround the school premises

  HOW TO CONFIGURE it To work.
